## Coding Conventions

### Naming

#### In-place vs out-of-place method pairs

When a method comes in two flavors — one that mutates through
`&mut self` and one that returns a new value from `&self` — name
them as a pair using the **`-ed` suffix** for the out-of-place
variant:

| in-place (`&mut self`)        | out-of-place (`&self`)         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `scale(&mut self, factor)`    | `scaled(&self, factor)`        |
| `normalize(&mut self)`        | `normalized(&self)`            |

Rationale:

- `&mut self` already conveys in-place mutation; an `_in_place`
  suffix is redundant.
- `-ed` reads naturally in English as "the X-ed version of self,"
  matching the semantic of "the value after applying X."
- Aligns with the standard library's `sort` (in-place) /
  `sorted` (out-of-place, on iterators) pattern.
